     <p class="purple-color"> 2020 - Present | Pro Level Developer </p>
     <p> I am the master of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I know everything needed to make a website function efficiently. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with the most popular JavaScript framework called Vue JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution. </p>

      <h3> Baby Web Developer </h3>
      <p class="purple-color"> 2019 - 202 | Programming Hero (Remote) </p>
      <p> They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero. </p>
